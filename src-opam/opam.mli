    The [branch] can be a git tag or branch (e.g. [2.0] for opam 2.0.x or [2.1] for
    the opam 2.1.x).
    The binaries are installed under [<prefix>/bin/opam-<branch>],
    defaulting to [/usr/local/bin].
    If [add_default_link] is true (the default), then the [opam-<branch>]
    binary is hardlinked to [opam].  Set it to false if you want to install
    multiple opam binaries from different branches in the same container.
    If [enable_0install_solver] is true (false by default), then the [builtin-0install]
    solver should be accessible in the resulting opam binary.
    Configure opam build [with_vendored_deps]. Required for opam 2.2. *)

    to be multiarch (the main exception to this is i386, which requires different
