    - [from] must be the first non-comment instruction in the Dockerfile.
    - [from] can appear multiple times within a single Dockerfile in order to
      create multiple images. Multiple FROM commands will result in a multi-stage
      build, and the [?from] argument to the {!copy} and {!add} functions
      can move artefacts across stages.

    By default, the stages are not named, and you refer to them by their
    integer number, starting with 0 for the first [FROM] instruction. However,
    you can name your stages, by supplying an [?alias] argument.  The alias
    can be supplied to the [?from] parameter to {!copy} or {!add} to refer
    to this particular stage by name.

    If no [tag] is supplied, [latest] is assumed. If the used tag does not
    exist, an error will be returned.

    The optional [platform] flag can be used to specify the platform of the
    image in case the [from] references a multi-platform image.  For example,
    [linux/386] could be used. By default, the target platform of the build
    request is ued if this is not specified.

    have permissions of 600. If the remote file being retrieved has an
    HTTP Last-Modified header, the timestamp from that header will be
    used to set the mtime on the destination file. Then, like any other
    file processed during an ADD, mtime will be included in the

val entrypoint : ('a, unit, string, t) format4 -> 'a
(** [entrypoint fmt] allows you to configure a container that will
    run as an executable.  The [fmt] string will be executed using
    a [/bin/sh] subshell.

    The shell form prevents any {!cmd} or {!run} command line arguments
    from being used, but has the disadvantage that your {!entrypoint}
    will be started as a subcommand of [/bin/sh -c], which does not pass
    signals. This means that the executable will not be the container's
    PID 1 - and will not receive Unix signals - so your executable will
    not receive a SIGTERM from [docker stop <container>].

    To get around this limitation, use the {!entrypoint_exec} command
    to directly execute an argument list without a subshell.
*)

val entrypoint_exec : string list -> t
(** [entrypoint fmt] allows you to configure a container that will

val shell : string list -> t
(** [shell t] allows the default shell used for the shell form of

val onbuild : t -> t

    another build. The trigger will be executed in the context of the
    downstream build, as if it had been inserted immediately after the
    {!from} instruction in the downstream Dockerfile.

    Any build instruction can be registered as a trigger.

    This is useful if you are building an image which will be used as a

val label : (string * string) list -> t
(** [label l] adds metadata to an image via a list of key-value pairs.
    To include spaces within a label value, use quotes and backslashes as
    you would in command-line parsing. An image can have more than one label.
    To specify multiple labels, Docker recommends combining labels into a
    single label instruction where possible. Each label instruction produces
    a new layer which can result in an inefficient image if you use many labels.

    Labels are additive including [LABEL]s in [FROM] images. If Docker
    encounters a label/key that already exists, the new value overrides any
    previous labels with identical keys.

    To view an image’s labels, use the [docker inspect] command. *)
